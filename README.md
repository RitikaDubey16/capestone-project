FindDefault (Prediction of Credit Card fraud)

FindDefault is a machine learning-based project designed to predict credit card fraud. By analyzing transaction data, the model identifies potentially fraudulent activity to help mitigate financial risks. The primary goal of this project is to build an effective and accurate model to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions.


## Features

Features
Real-time prediction: Model can classify transactions as either "fraudulent" or "legitimate".
Data pre-processing: Handles missing values, outliers, and normalization for improved model accuracy.
Multiple algorithms: Supports models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation metrics: Reports precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.



## Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt

    
## Usage

1. Train the model:

First, ensure that the dataset is prepared and placed in the /data directory.
Run the training script to train the machine learning model:

python train_model.py


2. Make predictions:

After the model is trained, use the following script to make predictions on new data:

python predict.py --input data/new_data.csv


3. Evaluate the model:

To evaluate the performance of the model, you can run:

python evaluate_model.py

## Model Description

Model Description
The model in FindDefault uses machine learning techniques to classify credit card transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. It employs models like:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
The model takes features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and anonymized customer information to predict fraud.
